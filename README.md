## Description

The **Habit Tracker App** is a simple yet effective way to track and record your daily habits. It allows users to:

This app provides a user-friendly interface with easy navigation and several useful features to monitor and improve your daily habits.

## User Story

### Main Features
- **Main View:**
  - Displays a list of up to 5 pinned habits. Each pinned habit shows the last recorded date and time in a readable format.
  - If there are fewer than 5 pinned habits, non-pinned habits will be listed below the pinned ones.
  
- **Add Habit History:**
  - You can add a new habit history by tapping on a habit in the list. 
  - A confirmation dialog will appear to confirm the action, and thereâ€™s also a cancel button to abort the process.
  - Once the add process is confirmed, the main view will update with the new information.

- **Add New Habit Record:**
  - A button located after the pinned list allows users to add a new habit.
  - Clicking this button changes the view to show a sorted list of all habit data (sorted alphabetically A-Z, 0-9).
  
- **All Habit Data View:**
  - The all habit data list can be searched by habit names through a search box at the top.
  - You can add a new habit history to any habit in this list, similar to how it's done from the main view.
  - A floating button is also available for adding new habit data.

- **Edit/Delete Habit:**
  - Each habit in the data list has action buttons for editing and deleting.
  - If delete is clicked, a confirmation dialog appears to confirm the deletion process.
  
- **Side Menu Drawer:**
  - A side menu provides navigation options with the following menus:
    - **All Habit Data**: View and manage your entire list of habits.
    - **Habit Report**: Generate and view reports of your habits.
    - **About**: Information about the app.
  
- **Habit Reports:**
  - The app allows you to generate habit reports based on:
    - **Weekly**
    - **Monthly**
    - **Custom Date Range**
  - The report will consist of a list of habit names with the average habit counter across the selected date range.
